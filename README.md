# Photo-ColorSketching: Extraction of Color from Images

Our paper focuses on different approaches to convert photographic pictures into colored sketches. We use the Contour Drawing Dataset presented in the Photo-Sketching paper and propose two ways to extract color information from the images and amalgamate it with the corresponding sketches. We formulate a process to transfer color onto the existing black and white sketches in the dataset to produce colored outline sketches. We propose another method to produce color-filled sketches by performing colorspace manipulation. We go a step further to use these sketches as the training dataset for a Generative Adversarial Network and develop a model which can generate colored sketches from unseen images.
